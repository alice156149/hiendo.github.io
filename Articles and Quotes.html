									<h2>Jim Rohn</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<li>Don't wish it were easier, wish you were better.</li>
										<li>The major value in life is not what you get. The major value in life is what you become.</li>
										<li>Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.</li>
										<li>Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.</li>
										<li>Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines, practiced every day.</li>
									
									</blockquote>

									<h2>Tony Robbins</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<li>The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment.</li>
										<li>Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.</li>
										<li>Your life changes the moment you make a new, congruent, and committed decision.</li>
										<li>If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten.</li>
									
									</blockquote>

									<h2>David Goggins</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<li>If you want to get better, do the things that no-one else wants to do. Do the things that no-one is even thinking about doing.</li>
										<li>Don’t stop when you’re tired. Stop when you’re done.</li>
										<li>You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft, that you will die without ever realizing your true potential.</li>
										<li>In life, there is no gift as overlooked or as inevitable as failure.</li>
										
									
									</blockquote>

									<h2>Kobe Bryant</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<li>The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do.</li>
										<li>Everything negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity for me to rise.</li>
										<li>I’ll do whatever it takes to win games, whether it’s sitting on a bench waving a towel, handing a cup of water to a teammate, or hitting the game-winning shot.</li>
										<li>I have nothing in common with lazy people who blame others for their lack of success. Great things come from hard work and perseverance. No excuses.</li>
										
									
									</blockquote>

									<h2>Elon Musk</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<li>When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.</li>
										<li>It’s very important to have a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better.</li>
										<li>The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.</li>
										<li>I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.</li>
										
									
									</blockquote>

									<h2>Simon Sinek</h2>
									<blockquote>
										<li>Leadership is not about being in charge. Leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.</li>
										<li>The goal is not to be perfect by the end. The goal is to be better today.</li>
										<li>You don’t hire for skills, you hire for attitude. You can always teach skills.</li>
										<li>Great leaders are those who can inspire others to believe in something bigger than themselves.</li>
